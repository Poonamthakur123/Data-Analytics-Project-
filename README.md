# Electric Vehicles Mini Project

## Overview
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) data to uncover trends in EV adoption, distribution, and other key insights. Using the dataset provided, the project visualizes various metrics, which can aid in understanding the growing EV population.

## Project Files
- **Electric vehicles mini project....123.twb**: A Tableau Workbook file containing data visualizations and analysis.
- **Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv**: The dataset used in this project, including information on electric vehicle registrations and related metrics.

## Key Features
- **Data Visualization**: The Tableau workbook includes several visualizations that highlight key insights, such as:
  - EV population growth trends over time
  - Distribution of EVs by region or type
  - Comparison of EV adoption rates
- **Data Analysis**: Using the dataset, this project provides insights into patterns of electric vehicle usage.

## Requirements
- **Tableau**: To open and explore the `.twb` file.
- **CSV Reader**: A tool to view and manipulate the `.csv` file, such as Excel or any programming environment capable of handling CSV data (e.g., Python, R).

## Installation and Usage
1. Download the files in this repository.
2. Open `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv` in a CSV viewer or data analysis tool to review the raw data.
3. Open `Electric vehicles mini project....123.twb` in Tableau to explore the pre-built visualizations.

## Dataset Details
The `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv` file contains fields that represent various attributes of electric vehicles, including:
- **Vehicle ID**: Unique identifier for each vehicle
- **Make and Model**: Manufacturer and model of the EV
- **Year of Manufacture**: Year the EV was manufactured
- **Region**: Geographic area of registration
- **Registration Date**: Date when the vehicle was registered
